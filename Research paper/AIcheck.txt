Abstract
Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a modern security paradigm that enforces the principle of "never trust, always verify" by continuously evaluating trust based on contextual signals and observed behavior, rather than relying on static perimeter assumptions. While ZTA has become foundational in enterprise security, most current implementations suffer from static policy enforcement and binary access decisions, limiting adaptability to evolving threats and user behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive implementation and evaluation of an AI-driven, event-based Zero Trust system that leverages machine learning for behavioral monitoring and dynamic trust scoring. Our system supports long-running training sessions, robust anomaly detection using Isolation Forest, and real-time trust management across three operational modes: Training, Live, and Admin. We compare our approach to existing ZTA systems, highlight their limitations, and demonstrate how our architecture overcomes operational gaps such as session persistence, adaptive trust scoring, and resilient model lifecycle management. The paper concludes with an evaluation of system accuracy, operational improvements, and future research directions.

Introduction

The rapid evolution of cyber threats and the increasing complexity of enterprise IT environments have rendered traditional perimeter-based security models obsolete. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a strategic response, emphasizing strict identity verification, least-privilege access, and continuous monitoring regardless of network location [nist800207]. Despite its promise, most ZTA implementations rely on static policies and binary access controls, which struggle to adapt to dynamic threat landscapes and subtle behavioral anomalies [rose2020zero, yu2021survey]. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have enabled the development of adaptive behavioral monitoring systems capable of detecting anomalies and evolving attack patterns in real time.

This paper presents a full implementation and evaluation of an AI-based Zero Trust system that integrates behavioral analytics and dynamic trust scoring into the ZTA framework. The system is designed to:

- Continuously collect and analyze user and system events to build behavioral baselines and detect anomalies.
- Employ an Isolation Forest model for unsupervised anomaly detection, enabling adaptive trust management.
- Operate across three modes—Training, Live, and Admin—to support robust model lifecycle management and operational resilience.
- Persist session state and event data to ensure recovery and continuity across backend restarts and long-running training sessions.
- Provide a real-time operator interface for monitoring, control, and trust score management.

We compare our system to representative ZTA approaches, discuss the limitations of existing solutions, and demonstrate how our architecture addresses operational gaps such as session persistence, adaptive trust scoring, and resilient anomaly detection. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work and existing ZTA systems; Section III presents a comparative analysis and identifies gaps; Section IV details the proposed system architecture and methodology; Section V describes implementation details; Section VI evaluates system performance and improvements; Section VII concludes with future work.

Related Work
Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has evolved from John Kindervag's original 2010 concept into a comprehensive security model formalized by standards such as NIST SP 800-207 [nist800207]. The core principle of ZTA is to eliminate implicit trust and continuously verify every transaction and access request based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Traditional ZTA implementations have focused primarily on network segmentation, identity and access management (IAM), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) [rose2020zero].

Recent literature has expanded ZTA's scope to address emerging challenges in cloud, IoT, and AI-powered environments. Obbu et al. demonstrate ZTA's effectiveness in protecting AI workloads in cloud environments, reducing attack surfaces and detection time, but note increased complexity and performance overhead [obbu2023cloud]. Yadav et al. introduce behavioral fingerprinting for real-time trust scoring, achieving high anomaly detection accuracy and rapid response, while highlighting privacy concerns and cold-start challenges [yadav2023behavioral]. Nasiruzzaman et al. trace ZTA's evolution and identify current issues such as control-plane vulnerabilities, asset-inventory gaps, and the need for automation [nasiruzzaman2023evolution].

Multiple thematic surveys and case studies illustrate the breadth of ZTA applications and limitations. Weinberg and Cohen survey ZTA in emerging technologies, focusing on policy automation and integration challenges [weinberg2023survey]. Wang et al. demonstrate a ZTA implementation in AWS, incorporating security controls through transparent proxies, while acknowledging difficulties in integrating legacy systems [wang2023aws]. ElSayed et al. present an IoT-focused ZTA utilizing machine learning for anomaly detection with lightweight models, supporting resource-constrained environments [elsayed2023iot].

Several works examine decentralized and AI-driven approaches. Pokhrel et al. combine federated learning and blockchain to create distributed trust computation mechanisms, albeit with additional latency and complexity [pokhrel2023federated]. Ahmadi and Hasan focus on identity-based segmentation and behavioral analytics for detecting insider threats, noting the need for rich identity data and privacy protection [ahmadi2023identity, hasan2023insider]. Gilkarov and Dubin employ "moving target defense" to address AI model robustness, while Gambo and Almulhem provide a systematic review categorizing ZTA research and outlining barriers such as cost, scalability, and compliance [gilkarov2023moving, gambo2023systematic].

Despite these advances, several critical limitations persist across current ZTA implementations:

- Static Policies and Trust Models: Most systems rely on fixed, one-time authentication and static access policies, making them less effective against dynamic threats and insider attacks [yadav2023behavioral, ahmadi2023identity, gambo2023systematic].
- Limited Behavioral Anomaly Detection: While some systems employ basic behavioral analytics, most lack real-time, adaptive mechanisms for detecting subtle or evolving attack patterns [yadav2023behavioral, elsayed2023iot, hasan2023insider].
- Integration and Scalability Challenges: High cost, complexity, and legacy integration issues prevent widespread ZTA adoption, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises [wang2023aws, gambo2023systematic, weinberg2023survey].
- Privacy and User Acceptance: Continuous behavioral monitoring raises privacy concerns and can negatively impact organizational culture and user trust [yadav2023behavioral, ahmadi2023identity].
- Model Lifecycle Management: Existing systems lack robust mechanisms for training, updating, and managing ML models in operational environments, limiting their adaptability to changing user behavior [obbu2023cloud, elsayed2023iot].

These gaps motivate the need for a new ZTA implementation that leverages AI for real-time behavioral anomaly detection with dynamic trust scoring, designed to minimize false positives while effectively detecting insider threats and advanced persistent threats. The system proposed in this paper aims to be modular, scalable, and practical for deployment across diverse organizational contexts.

Comparative Analysis and Identified Gaps
Our analysis of existing ZTA systems reveals several critical operational and technical gaps that limit their effectiveness in dynamic enterprise environments. Table: Limitations of existing ZTA implementations

Category: Key Limitations
Static Policy Systems: Fixed authentication rules, binary access decisions, inability to adapt to behavioral changes
Cloud-based Solutions: High complexity, vendor lock-in, limited customization, integration challenges with legacy systems
IoT-focused ZTA: Resource constraints limit ML capabilities, scalability issues, limited behavioral modeling
Academic Prototypes: Lack operational robustness, no session persistence, limited real-world validation

Critical Gap Analysis
Adaptive Trust Management: Current systems predominantly use static trust models that fail to account for evolving user behavior patterns and contextual changes. This limitation makes them vulnerable to insider threats and advanced persistent attacks that operate within normal access patterns over extended periods.

Real-time Anomaly Detection: While some systems incorporate behavioral monitoring, few provide real-time anomaly detection with adaptive thresholds. Most rely on predefined rules or simple statistical measures that generate high false positive rates in dynamic environments.

Operational Resilience: Existing academic and prototype systems lack the operational hardening necessary for production deployment, including session persistence, recovery mechanisms, and robust model lifecycle management.

Integration Complexity: Enterprise ZTA solutions often require extensive infrastructure changes and specialized expertise, creating barriers to adoption for organizations with limited security resources or legacy systems.

Proposed System Architecture
To address the identified gaps, we propose an AI-driven, event-based Zero Trust Architecture that integrates behavioral monitoring, dynamic trust scoring, and adaptive anomaly detection. The system operates across three distinct modes—Training, Live, and Admin—to provide comprehensive security coverage while maintaining operational simplicity.

System Components
Proposed system components and descriptions:

- Event Collector: A platform-agnostic telemetry collection engine that monitors system events including process execution, network connections, file modifications, authentication attempts, and administrative commands.
- Backend API (FastAPI): RESTful control endpoints for training management (/api/train/*), event ingestion (/api/events), live monitoring (/api/live/*), and administrative functions (/api/admin/*), with WebSocket support (/ws) for real-time communication.
- Persistence Layer (SQLite/SQLAlchemy): Robust data storage for training sessions, collected events, detected anomalies, and model artifacts, with transaction support and recovery capabilities.
- WebSocket Manager: Real-time communication hub that maintains client connections and broadcasts session updates, events, and alerts to connected frontends.
- ML Engine: Isolation Forest-based unsupervised learning component for behavioral baseline establishment and real-time anomaly detection.
- Trust Scorer: Dynamic trust management engine that calculates and maintains user/system trust scores based on detected anomalies and contextual factors.
- Frontend Interface (Next.js): Web-based operator console providing training control, live monitoring, anomaly visualization, and administrative management capabilities.

Operational Modes
The system operates across three distinct modes, each designed to address specific phases of the Zero Trust lifecycle:

Training Mode
Training Mode establishes behavioral baselines for users and systems through supervised data collection. When activated through the operator interface, the system:

- Creates a new training session with persistent state management
- Continuously collects system events including process_start, process_end, network_connection, sudo_command, file_change, login, logout, and auth_failure
- Logs all events without affecting trust scores, allowing normal operations to continue
- Persists session state to enable recovery across system restarts
- Upon completion, trains the Isolation Forest model on collected behavioral patterns

Training Mode is designed to run for extended periods (hours to days) to capture comprehensive behavioral baselines across different user activities, time periods, and system states.

Live Mode
Live Mode provides real-time anomaly detection and trust scoring using models trained in the previous phase. The system:

- Requires completion of at least one training session before activation
- Continuously evaluates incoming events against established behavioral baselines
- Displays only detected anomalies rather than all system events, reducing noise for operators
- Maintains dynamic trust scores that update in real-time based on anomaly severity and frequency
- Triggers immediate alerts when trust scores drop below critical thresholds (default: 20)
- Provides contextual information for each anomaly to support rapid investigation

Admin Mode
Admin Mode enables security operators to refine the system's behavioral understanding and manage trust scoring. Key capabilities include:

- Comprehensive view of all anomalies detected during the current live session
- Ability to mark false positives as "normal," updating training datasets and restoring trust points
- Historical analysis of trust score changes and anomaly patterns
- Full system reset functionality to clear training data and restart behavioral learning
- Model performance monitoring and retraining controls

Data Flow and System Integration
The system implements an event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns:

System Events -> (real-time collection) -> Event Collector -> (structured event data) -> ML Engine -> (anomaly scores) -> Trust Scorer -> (dynamic trust updates) -> Alert System / Operator Interface

Event Processing Pipeline:

1. Collection: The Event Collector continuously monitors system activities across multiple sources (processes, network, filesystem, authentication logs)
2. Persistence: Events are written to the database in dedicated threads to maintain system responsiveness
3. Analysis: The ML Engine evaluates events against trained models to detect behavioral anomalies
4. Scoring: The Trust Scorer updates dynamic trust values based on anomaly severity and context
5. Response: Alerts and interface updates are broadcast via WebSocket to connected operators

Implementation Details

Machine Learning Engine
The ML Engine implements an Isolation Forest algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection, chosen for its effectiveness in identifying outliers in high-dimensional behavioral data without requiring labeled training examples.

Feature Engineering
The system extracts comprehensive behavioral features from collected events:

- Temporal Features: Hour of day, day of week to capture time-based behavioral patterns
- Event Type Encoding: One-hot encoded representation of event categories
- Process Characteristics: Hashed process names and execution patterns
- Network Behavior: Connection destinations, protocols, and frequency metrics
- Authentication Patterns: Success rates, failure frequencies, and user context
- File System Activity: Change severity, access patterns, and modification frequencies

Feature vectors are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent model performance across different event types and scales.

Model Training Process
During Training Mode completion, the system:

1. Extracts features from all collected session events
2. Applies standardization and normalization preprocessing
3. Trains an Isolation Forest model with contamination factor 0.1 (assuming 10% anomaly rate)
4. Validates model performance on held-out data
5. Persists the trained model and preprocessing components for deployment

Dynamic Trust Scoring
The Trust Scorer implements a weighted, adaptive scoring mechanism that maintains user and system trust levels based on detected anomalies.

Trust Calculation
Trust scores are calculated using configurable event weights:

Trust_new = max(0, Trust_current - W_event * C_anomaly)

Where W_event represents event-specific weights (auth_failure: -25, sudo_command: -20, network_connection: -15, etc.) and C_anomaly is the anomaly confidence score from the ML model.

Alert Generation
The system triggers immediate alerts when:

- Trust scores drop below the critical threshold (default: 20)
- Multiple high-confidence anomalies occur within short time windows
- Specific high-risk events (authentication failures, unauthorized privilege escalation) are detected

Backend Architecture
The backend implements several key engineering decisions for operational robustness:

- Asynchronous Event Processing: Uses asyncio.to_thread for database operations to maintain responsiveness during high event volumes
- Session Persistence: Training sessions survive backend restarts through database-backed state management
- Concurrent Operation Guards: In-memory flags prevent race conditions during critical operations like training completion
- Real-time Communication: WebSocket connections provide immediate updates to operator interfaces
- Modular Architecture: Clear separation between event collection, ML processing, trust scoring, and interface components

The training session lifecycle follows a structured process as outlined below:

Training Session Management Process:

1. Initialize new session with unique ID and timestamp
2. Activate event collection across all monitored sources
3. Persist events to database with session association
4. Broadcast real-time events to connected operators
5. On stop request: validate session and extract features
6. Train Isolation Forest model on collected session data
7. Update session with model version and completion status
8. Prepare system for Live Mode activation

Frontend Implementation
The operator interface is built using Next.js and React, providing real-time monitoring and control capabilities:

- Real-time Communication: WebSocket client with automatic reconnection and message dispatching for live event streaming
- Mode-specific Interfaces: Dedicated UI components for Training, Live, and Admin modes with appropriate controls and visualizations
- Session Recovery: Automatic restoration of interface state after browser refresh or reconnection
- Operational Safety: NoReloadGuard component prevents accidental session interruption during critical operations
- Trust Score Visualization: Real-time gauge displaying current trust levels with threshold indicators
- Anomaly Dashboard: Comprehensive view of detected anomalies with filtering and analysis capabilities
