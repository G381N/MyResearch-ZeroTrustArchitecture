\title{Enhancing Zero Trust Architecture through AI-Based Behavioral Monitoring and Dynamic Trust Scoring: An Implementation and Comparative Analysis}

\author{Gebin George\\Christ University\\gebin.george@mca.christuniversity.in}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a modern security
paradigm that enforces the principle of ”never trust, always verify”
by continuously evaluating trust based on contextual signals
and observed behavior, rather than relying on static perimeter
assumptions. While ZTA has become foundational in enterprise
security, most current implementations suffer from static policy
enforcement and binary access decisions, limiting adaptability
to evolving threats and user behavior. This paper presents a
comprehensive implementation and evaluation of an AI-driven,
event-based Zero Trust system that leverages machine learning
for behavioral monitoring and dynamic trust scoring. My system
supports long-running training sessions, robust anomaly detection
using Isolation Forest, and real-time trust management across
three operational modes: Training, Live, and Admin. I compare
my approach to existing ZTA systems, highlight their limitations,
and demonstrate how my architecture overcomes operational
gaps such as session persistence, adaptive trust scoring, and
resilient model lifecycle management. The paper concludes with
an evaluation of system accuracy, operational improvements, and
future research directions.

\section{Introduction}

The quick rise of cyber threats and the increasing
complexity of enterprise IT environments have rendered
traditional perimeter-based security models obsolete. Zero
Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a strategic response,
emphasizing strict identity verification, least-privilege access,
and continuous monitoring regardless of network location~\cite{nist800207}. Despite its promise, most ZTA implementations rely on static
policies and binary access controls, which struggle to adapt to
dynamic threat landscapes and subtle behavioral anomalies~\cite{rose2020zero, yu2021survey}. The recent growth in artificial intelligence and machine
learning have enabled the development of adaptive
behavioral monitoring systems capable of detecting anomalies
and evolving attack patterns in real time.
This paper presents a full implementation and evaluation
of an AI-based Zero Trust system that integrates behavioral
analytics and dynamic trust scoring into the ZTA framework.
The system is designed to:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Continuously collect and analyze user and system events to
build behavioral baselines and detect anomalies.
  \item Employ an Isolation Forest model for unsupervised anomaly
detection, enabling adaptive trust management.
  \item Operate across three modes—Training, Live, and Admin—to
support robust model lifecycle management and operational
resilience.
  \item Persist session state and event data to ensure recovery and
continuity across backend restarts and long-running training
sessions.
  \item Provide a real-time operator interface for monitoring, control,
and trust score management.
\end{itemize}

We compare our system to representative ZTA approaches,
discuss the limitations of existing solutions, and demonstrate
how our architecture addresses operational gaps such as
session persistence, adaptive trust scoring, and resilient anomaly
detection. The data present in the paper are organized as follows:  
SectionII reviews related work and existing ZTA systems;
Section III presents a comparative analysis and identifies
gaps; Section IV details the proposed system architecture
and methodology; Section V describes implementation details;
Section VI evaluates system performance and improvements;
Section VII concludes with future work.

\section{Related Work}
Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has evolved from John
Kindervag’s original 2010 concept into a comprehensive
security model formalized by standards such as NIST SP 800-
207~\cite{nist800207}. The core principle of ZTA is to eliminate implicit
trust and continuously verify every transaction and access
request based on the principle of ”never trust, always verify.”
Traditional ZTA implementations have focused primarily on
network segmentation, identity and access management (IAM),
and multi-factor authentication (MFA)~\cite{rose2020zero}.

Recent literature has expanded ZTA’s scope to address emerging challenges in cloud, IoT, and AI-powered environments.
Obbu et al. demonstrate ZTA’s effectiveness in protecting AI
workloads in cloud environments, reducing attack surfaces and
detection time, but note increased complexity and performance
overhead~\cite{obbu2023cloud}. Yadav et al. introduce behavioral fingerprinting
for real-time trust scoring, achieving high anomaly detection
accuracy and rapid response, while highlighting privacy concerns and cold-start challenges~\cite{yadav2023behavioral}. Nasiruzzaman et al. trace
ZTA’s evolution and identify current issues such as controlplane vulnerabilities, asset-inventory gaps, and the need for
automation~\cite{nasiruzzaman2023evolution}.

Multiple thematic surveys and case studies illustrate the
breadth of ZTA applications and limitations. Weinberg and
Cohen survey ZTA in emerging technologies, focusing on
policy automation and integration challenges~\cite{weinberg2023survey}. Wang et al.
demonstrate a ZTA implementation in AWS, incorporating
security controls through transparent proxies, while acknowledging difficulties in integrating legacy systems~\cite{wang2023aws}. ElSayed
et al. present an IoT-focused ZTA utilizing machine learning
for anomaly detection with lightweight models, supporting
resource-constrained environments~\cite{elsayed2023iot}.

Several works examine decentralized and AI-driven approaches. Pokhrel et al. combine federated learning and
blockchain to create distributed trust computation mechanisms,
albeit with additional latency and complexity~\cite{pokhrel2023federated}. Ahmadi and
Hasan focus on identity-based segmentation and behavioral
analytics for detecting insider threats, noting the need for rich
identity data and privacy protection~\cite{ahmadi2023identity, hasan2023insider}. Gilkarov and
Dubin employ ”moving target defense” to address AI model
robustness, while Gambo and Almulhem provide a systematic
review categorizing ZTA research and outlining barriers such
as cost, scalability, and compliance~\cite{gilkarov2023moving, gambo2023systematic}.

Despite these growths in ZTA, several critical constraints persist
across current ZTA implementations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Static Policies and Trust Models:} Most systems rely on
fixed, one-time authentication and static access policies,
making them less effective against dynamic threats and
insider attacks~\cite{yadav2023behavioral, ahmadi2023identity, gambo2023systematic}.
    \item \textbf{Limited Behavioral Anomaly Detection:} While some
systems employ basic behavioral analytics, most lack realtime, adaptive mechanisms for detecting subtle or evolving
attack patterns~\cite{yadav2023behavioral, elsayed2023iot, hasan2023insider}.
    \item \textbf{Integration and Scalability Challenges:} the increased in cost, elaborateness, and integration with legacy systems cause problems that prevent its widespread use,
ZTA adoption, especially for small and medium-sized
enterprises~\cite{wang2023aws, gambo2023systematic, weinberg2023survey}.
    \item \textbf{Privacy and User Acceptance:} Continuous behavioral
monitoring raises privacy concerns and can negatively
impact organizational culture and user trust~\cite{yadav2023behavioral, ahmadi2023identity}.
    \item \textbf{Model Lifecycle Management:} Existing systems lack
robust mechanisms for training, updating, and managing
ML models in operational environments, limiting their
adaptability to changing user behavior~\cite{obbu2023cloud, elsayed2023iot}.
\end{itemize}

These gaps highlight the need for a new ZTA implementation that utilizes AI for real-time behavioral anomaly detection with dynamic trust scoring. This implementation is designed to minimize false positives while effectively identifying insider threats and advanced persistent threats. The system proposed in this paper aims to be
modular, scalable, and practical for deployment across diverse
organizational contexts.

\section{Comparative Analysis and Identified Gaps}
Our analysis of existing ZTA systems reveals several critical operational and technical gaps that limit their effectiveness in dynamic enterprise environments. Table~\ref{tab:existing_gaps} summarizes the key limitations across different categories of ZTA implementations.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Limitations of existing ZTA implementations}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{6cm}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Key Limitations} \\
\midrule
Static Policy Systems & Fixed authentication rules, binary access decisions, inability to adapt to behavioral changes \\
Cloud-based Solutions & High complexity, vendor lock-in, limited customization, integration challenges with legacy systems \\
IoT-focused ZTA & Resource constraints limit ML capabilities, scalability issues, limited behavioral modeling \\
Academic Prototypes & Lack operational robustness, no session persistence, limited real-world validation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:existing_gaps}
\end{table}

\subsection{Critical Gap Analysis}
\textbf{Adaptive Trust Management:} The current systems that are being us3ed now mostly use static trust models that fail to account for evolving
user behavior patterns and contextual changes. This limitation
makes them vulnerable to insider threats and advanced persistent attacks that operate within normal access patterns over
extended periods.

\textbf{Real-time Anomaly Detection:} While some of the existing systems incorporate behavioral monitoring, a few provide real-time anomaly
detection with adaptive thresholds. Most rely on predefined
rules or simple statistical measures that generate high false
positive rates in dynamic environments.

\textbf{Operational Resilience:} Existing academic and prototype
systems lack the operational hardening necessary for production
deployment, including session persistence, recovery mechanisms, and robust model lifecycle management.

\textbf{Integration Complexity:} Enterprise ZTA solutions often
require extensive infrastructure changes and specialized expertise, creating barriers to adoption for organizations with limited
security resources or legacy systems.

\section{Proposed System Architecture}
To address the identified gaps, we propose an AI-driven, event-based Zero Trust Architecture that integrates behavioral monitoring, dynamic trust scoring, and adaptive anomaly detection. The system operates across three distinct modes—Training, Live, and Admin—to provide comprehensive security coverage while maintaining operational simplicity.

\subsection{System Components}
Figure~\ref{fig:arch} illustrates the high-level architecture of the proposed system. The core components include:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Event Collector:} A platform-agnostic telemetry collection engine that monitors system events including process execution, network connections, file modifications, authentication attempts, and administrative commands.
  \item \textbf{Backend API (FastAPI):} RESTful control endpoints for training management (\texttt{/api/train/*}), event ingestion (\texttt{/api/events}), live monitoring (\texttt{/api/live/*}), and administrative functions (\texttt{/api/admin/*}), with WebSocket support (\texttt{/ws}) for real-time communication.
  \item \textbf{Persistence Layer (SQLite/SQLAlchemy):} Robust data storage for training sessions, collected events, detected anomalies, and model artifacts, with transaction support and recovery capabilities.
  \item \textbf{WebSocket Manager:} Real-time communication hub that maintains client connections and broadcasts session updates, events, and alerts to connected frontends.
  \item \textbf{ML Engine:} Isolation Forest-based unsupervised learning component for behavioral baseline establishment and real-time anomaly detection.
  \item \textbf{Trust Scorer:} Dynamic trust management engine that calculates and maintains user/system trust scores based on detected anomalies and contextual factors.
  \item \textbf{Frontend Interface (Next.js):} Web-based operator console providing training control, live monitoring, anomaly visualization, and administrative management capabilities.
\end{itemize}

  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{architecture_diagram_placeholder.png}
  \caption{Proposed Zero Trust Architecture system components and data flow.}
  \label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Operational Modes}
The system operates across three distinct modes, each designed to address specific phases of the Zero Trust lifecycle:

\subsubsection{Training Mode}
Training Mode establishes behavioral baselines for users and systems through supervised data collection. When activated through the operator interface, the system:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Creates a new training session with persistent state management
  \item Continuously collects system events including \texttt{process\_start}, \texttt{process\_end}, \texttt{network\_connection}, \texttt{sudo\_command}, \texttt{file\_change}, \texttt{login}, \texttt{logout}, and \texttt{auth\_failure}
  \item Logs all events without affecting trust scores, allowing normal operations to continue
  \item Persists session state to enable recovery across system restarts
  \item Upon completion, trains the Isolation Forest model on collected behavioral patterns
\end{itemize}

Training Mode is designed to run for extended periods (hours to days) to capture comprehensive behavioral baselines across different user activities, time periods, and system states.

\subsubsection{Live Mode}
Live Mode provides real-time anomaly detection and trust scoring using models trained in the previous phase. The system:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Requires completion of at least one training session before activation
  \item Continuously evaluates incoming events against established behavioral baselines
  \item Displays only detected anomalies rather than all system events, reducing noise for operators
  \item Maintains dynamic trust scores that update in real-time based on anomaly severity and frequency
  \item Triggers immediate alerts when trust scores drop below critical thresholds (default: 20)
  \item Provides contextual information for each anomaly to support rapid investigation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Admin Mode}
Admin Mode enables security operators to refine the system's behavioral understanding and manage trust scoring. Key capabilities include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Comprehensive view of all anomalies detected during the current live session
  \item Ability to mark false positives as "normal," updating training datasets and restoring trust points
  \item Historical analysis of trust score changes and anomaly patterns
  \item Full system reset functionality to clear training data and restart behavioral learning
  \item Model performance monitoring and retraining controls
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Flow and System Integration}
The system implements an event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns:

\begin{center}
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{1.5em}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\textbf{System Events} \\[-0.5ex]
$\downarrow$ \textit{(real-time collection)} \\[-0.5ex]

$\downarrow$ \textit{(dynamic trust updates)} \\[-0.5ex]
\textbf{Alert System / Operator Interface}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Event Processing Pipeline:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Collection:} The Event Collector continuously monitors system activities across multiple sources (processes, network, filesystem, authentication logs)
    \item \textbf{Persistence:} Events are written to the database in dedicated threads to maintain system responsiveness
    \item \textbf{Analysis:} The ML Engine evaluates events against trained models to detect behavioral anomalies
    \item \textbf{Scoring:} The Trust Scorer updates dynamic trust values based on anomaly severity and context
    \item \textbf{Response:} Alerts and interface updates are broadcast via WebSocket to connected operators
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Machine Learning Engine}
The ML Engine implements an Isolation Forest algorithm for
unsupervised anomaly detection, chosen for its effectiveness in
identifying outliers in high-dimensional behavioral data without
requiring labeled training examples.

\subsubsection{Feature Engineering}
The system extracts comprehensive
behavioral features from collected events:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Temporal Features:} Hour of day, day of week to capture
time-based behavioral patterns
  \item \textbf{Event Type Encoding:} One-hot encoded representation of
event categories
  \item \textbf{Process Characteristics:} Hashed process names and execution patterns
  \item \textbf{Network Behavior:} Connection destinations, protocols, and
frequency metrics  
  \item \textbf{Authentication Patterns:} Success rates, failure frequencies,
and user context
  \item \textbf{File System Activity:} Change severity, access patterns, and
modification frequencies
\end{itemize}

Feature vectors are standardized using StandardScaler
to ensure consistent model performance across different event
types and scales.

\subsubsection{Model Training Process}
During Training Mode completion, the system:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extracts features from all collected session events
    \item Applies standardization and normalization preprocessing
    \item Trains an Isolation Forest model with contamination factor 0.1 (assuming 10\% anomaly rate)
    \item Validates model performance on held-out data
    \item Persists the trained model and preprocessing components for deployment
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dynamic Trust Scoring}
The Trust Scorer implements a weighted, adaptive scoring
mechanism that maintains user and system trust levels based
on detected anomalies.

\subsubsection{Trust Calculation}
Trust scores are calculated using configurable event weights:
\begin{align}
\text{Trust}_{new} = \max(0, \text{Trust}_{current} - W_{event} \times C_{anomaly})
\end{align}

Where $W_{event}$ represents event-specific weights (\texttt{auth\_failure}: -25, \texttt{sudo\_command}: -20, \texttt{network\_connection}: -15, etc.) and $C_{anomaly}$ is the anomaly confidence score from the ML model.

\subsubsection{Alert Generation}
The system triggers immediate alerts when:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Trust scores drop below the critical threshold (default: 20)
  \item Multiple high-confidence anomalies occur within short time windows
  \item Specific high-risk events (authentication failures, unauthorized privilege escalation) are detected
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backend Architecture}
The backend implements several key engineering decisions
for operational robustness:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Asynchronous Event Processing:} Uses \texttt{asyncio.to\_thread} for database operations to maintain responsiveness during high event volumes
  \item \textbf{Session Persistence:} Training sessions survive backend restarts through database-backed state management
  \item \textbf{Concurrent Operation Guards:} In-memory flags prevent race conditions during critical operations like training completion
  \item \textbf{Real-time Communication:} WebSocket connections provide immediate updates to operator interfaces
  \item \textbf{Modular Architecture:} Clear separation between event collection, ML processing, trust scoring, and interface components
\end{itemize}

The training session lifecycle follows a structured process as outlined below:

\textbf{Training Session Management Process:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize new session with unique ID and timestamp
    \item Activate event collection across all monitored sources
    \item Persist events to database with session association
    \item Broadcast real-time events to connected operators
    \item On stop request: validate session and extract features
    \item Train Isolation Forest model on collected session data
    \item Update session with model version and completion status
    \item Prepare system for Live Mode activation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Frontend Implementation}
The operator interface is built using Next.js and React,
providing real-time monitoring and control capabilities:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Real-time Communication:} WebSocket client with automatic reconnection and message dispatching for live event streaming
  \item \textbf{Mode-specific Interfaces:} Dedicated UI components for Training, Live, and Admin modes with appropriate controls and visualizations
  \item \textbf{Session Recovery:} Automatic restoration of interface state after browser refresh or reconnection
  \item \textbf{Operational Safety:} \texttt{NoReloadGuard} component prevents accidental session interruption during critical operations
  \item \textbf{Trust Score Visualization:} Real-time gauge displaying current trust levels with threshold indicators
  \item \textbf{Anomaly Dashboard:} Comprehensive view of detected anomalies with filtering and analysis capabilities
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation and Results}

controlled user activity simulation
  \item \textbf{Training Data:} consists of 48-hour baseline collection periods.
normal user and system behavior
  \item \textbf{Anomaly Simulation:} The system needs to predict attacks like privilage escalations, unusual login times, usage of unusual sudo commands and lastly anything that affects events that are being supervised from the trained data.
  \item \textbf{Performance Metrics:} Detection accuracy, false positive
rates, system responsiveness, and resource utilization
\end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints:} SQLite and single-process FastAPI architecture limit throughput for enterprise-scale telemetry rates. Migration to distributed databases and message queues would be required for large deployments.
  \item \textbf{Model Lifecycle:} The current train-on-stop approach does not support incremental learning or continuous model updates, limiting adaptability to rapidly changing behavioral patterns.
  \item \textbf{Authentication and Authorization:} The prototype lacks production-grade access controls, requiring integration with OAuth2/JWT and role-based access control systems for operational deployment.
  \item \textbf{Cross-platform Support:} Event collection is currently optimized for Linux/Unix environments, requiring additional development for comprehensive Windows and macOS support.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

an AI-driven Zero Trust Architecture system that addresses
critical gaps in existing security frameworks through behavioral monitoring, dynamic trust scoring, and operational
resilience. The system successfully integrates three operational
modes—Training, Live, and Admin—to provide adaptive
security coverage while maintaining practical deployment
characteristics.

\subsection{Key Contributions}

mechanisms that enable multi-hour training sessions with
robust state management across system interruptions

\textbf{Advanced ML Techniques:} Implementation of continuous learning algorithms, ensemble methods, and deep learning approaches for improved anomaly detection accuracy and reduced false positive rates.

\textbf{Cross-platform Integration:} Extension of event collection capabilities to support comprehensive Windows, macOS, and cloud-native environments with standardized telemetry formats.

\textbf{Policy Integration:} Development of automated policy recommendation systems that translate detected behavioral patterns into actionable security policies for existing IAM and access control systems.

The implemented system demonstrates that sophisticated Zero Trust capabilities can be achieved through practical, deployable architectures that balance security effectiveness with operational simplicity. As the amount of cyber threats continue to evolve, adaptive security systems that learn from user behavior while maintaining robust operational characteristics will become
increasingly critical for organizational security postures.
